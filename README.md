MLgrating (MultiLayer grating) is a program for simulating the efficiency of gratings used on beamlines at large-scale light sources 
such as synchrotrons and free-electron lasers. The program allows the efficiency of gratings with both trapezoidal and saw tooth 
profiles to be simulated. It also enables the efficiency of multilayer gratings (gratings with multilayer coatings) to be simulated. 
The input parameters have been defined to match the units and nomenclature established in REFLEC (Sch√§fers and Krumrey, BESSY Technical 
Report 201/96 (1996)).
